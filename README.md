## My process
The first thing that I did was to add my custom footer. Then I made a draft html layout based on the design specification given. Next I commented out the draft html and created a prototype game where instead of cool icons, its just an input field. The purpose of the prototype is to check if the script I made strictly follows the conditions indicated in the rules modal.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
